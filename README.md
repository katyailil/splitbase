## How it works

Anyone can send ETH to the proxy (the contract receives funds).  
Recipients withdraw using `release(<address>)`, which transfers their accrued share.

- Shares are in **permille** (e.g., `600,400` = 60%/40%).  
- The sum of all `SHARES` must be exactly **1000**.

## Security Notes

No third-party audit. Use at your own risk.
For production, set the proxy owner to a Gnosis Safe (multisig).
Preserve storage layout for upgrades.
